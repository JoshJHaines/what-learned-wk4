# What We Learned -4

### Concepts

- Functions
- Functions with Parameters
- Calling Functions
- Booleans
- If / Else Statements

### Implementation

##### Functions
We created basic functions to perform things like math operations 

##### Functions with Parameters
We added onto functions by using Parameters to pull in variables to make them a bit more dynamic.

##### Calling Functions
We took our ability to create the function and we practiced calling them using Quokka.

##### Booleans
We learned how how to return a Boolean by returning the Parameter that either meets a condition or using the OR variable.

##### If / Else Statements
We used the boolean statements inside an IF statement. If it was within the if statement, it performed a task, if not it performed another.
